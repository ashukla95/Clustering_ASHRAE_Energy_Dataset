# Clustering_ASHRAE_Energy_Dataset
This project contains code that performs clustering on 4 types of resources (electricity, water, steam, hotwater) meter readings provided by ashrae. 
A different type of aggregation is used to perform the clustering. 
Outcome: Hierarchical clustering with DTW distance (time series similarity measuring distance) works best along with spectral clustering.
